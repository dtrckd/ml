# IBP

* Split-merge moves for MH (see thesis ibp chapt 3.3 and neal07 and BMF)
* two parameters
* poisson gamma !
* slice sampling ?! (these ibp...)
* Optimisation, take subset of bilinear matrix where the feature updated is active the relation ! sparse matrix ?


* predict result framework (numpy.ma ?)
IPB mask for test sub indices in matrice to keep the matrice product !

## Optimization
* is flat operation costly ? Because a lot occur in W_sample() !
