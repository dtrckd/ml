Convergence Remarque:

### For poisson Iteration
At the burnin it start to increase and make ~20 iteration to go below the starting point :o

### Random

### LDA
Get some coordinate of simplex for geometric tracking of dirichlet distribution (nice :p)

## Perplexity
If init a only one topic, perplextiy very low. So how can  we use only this measure ???
